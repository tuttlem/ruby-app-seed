Ruby Application Template
===========================================================

0. About
-----------------------------------------------------------

Basic file and directory structure for writing ad-hoc or
one off ruby applications that include documentation and
testing directories.

No implementation should be listed within this directory
structure. It's just easy to pull this repository down into
a new folder from where ever and start work on a new 
application without the startup hassle.

1. Folder structure
-----------------------------------------------------------

Folder structure should be used as follows:

- bin/
Should hold a script file marked as executable that will
not do much other than execute the main ruby script.

- conf/
Any extra configuration files that need to go along with
the executable. Found this to be a good spot for any yaml 
or loose XML files.

- data/
This has been used in the past as the folder to hold any
database associated with the application. Most applications
have only ever used a SQLite database, so this folder holds
that nicely.

- lib/
Holds the source code for the application. The lib/ folder
should contain a folder that is the same name as the 
application which will hold ruby files for the application.
Any extra external source code can go into this folder also 
listed under their respective folders.

- man/
Documentation for the application

- test/
Test fixtures for the application. The Rakefile is already 
setup to execute tests listed in this folder.

2. Using the project structure
-----------------------------------------------------------

	2.1. Fill out the Gemfile

	Put the items in the gem file that are needed for your 
	project. An example is as follows:

	source "http://rubygems.org"
	gem "nokogiri"
	gem "rack", "~>1.1"
	gem "rspec", :require => "spec"

	2.2. Install the required gems

	At the console, run the following

	$ bundle install
	$ git add Gemfile.lock

3. TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Would really like to make this into a generator of some
  sort

- Would like to add a rule into the Rakefile that will 
  build documentation on demand

- Add the "bundle install" command as a dependency into the
  Rakefile so there is some form of automation when 
  installing gem dependencies
